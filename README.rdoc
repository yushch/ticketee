== Ticktee barebone project


Things will cover:

* Tracks tickets (of course) and groups them into projects

* Provides a way to restrict users to certain projects

* Allows users to upload files to tickets

* Lets users tag tickets so theyâ€™re easy to find

* Provides an API on which users can base development of their own applications


The whole stuff would be coded in an TDD/BDD way.
